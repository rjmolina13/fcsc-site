The **University Student Council (USC)** is thrilled to announce the launch of a groundbreaking platform designed to enhance accessibility and transparency within its organization. This innovative initiative aims to provide students with a comprehensive index/catalog of essential documents such as issuances, constitutions, resolutions, and memos, including the Constitution and By-Laws (CBL). By consolidating these vital resources into one centralized location, the USC is empowering its student body with easy access to the information they need.

The new platform, powered by GitHub Pages, offers a seamless browsing experience for students. Leveraging the reliability and versatility of GitHub Pages, the USC has created a site that encourages active participation and community engagement. Students can confidently navigate the platform to retrieve the relevant documents they seek, breaking down barriers and fostering a more informed student body.

To ensure the site's quality and maintenance, the USC will be moderated by the whole council but mainly through the CICT-CSC President *Ronanj Molina*. This collaborative approach guarantees that the platform remains up to date and accurate, reflecting the USC's commitment to transparency.

In conclusion, this new platform, powered by GitHub Pages, represents a significant step forward in promoting transparency and inclusivity within the university community. By offering a user-friendly index/catalog of essential documents, the USC empowers students to actively participate in shaping their university experience. With the help of other organizatons and other key people involved, the platform ensures the site's quality and accuracy, fostering an environment where students can make informed decisions that positively impact their education and campus life.
